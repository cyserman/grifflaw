# Commonwealth v. Hunte: Pennsylvania Supreme Court Strikes Down Warrantless DUI Blood Draws

*By Steve Griffiths, Criminal Defense Attorney*

**Published: January 13, 2026**

On June 17, 2025, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court delivered a unanimous and unequivocal victory for constitutional rights in DUI cases. In *Commonwealth v. Hunte*, the Court struck down Section 3755 of the Vehicle Code, which had allowed police to conduct warrantless blood draws on unconscious DUI suspects. This landmark decision reaffirms that even in the context of DUI investigations, the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement cannot be casually discarded.

## The Background: Section 3755 and "Implied Consent"

For years, Pennsylvania law under 75 Pa.C.S. § 3755 permitted law enforcement to draw blood from unconscious motorists suspected of DUI without obtaining a warrant. The statute was premised on Pennsylvania's "implied consent" law, which states that by operating a vehicle on Pennsylvania roads, drivers implicitly consent to chemical testing if suspected of DUI.

The theory was straightforward: if you're driving in Pennsylvania, you've already consented to blood testing. If you're unconscious and can't explicitly consent or refuse, the law treated your prior implied consent as sufficient authorization for police to extract your blood without judicial oversight.

This practice became routine in Pennsylvania DUI investigations. When officers encountered an unconscious motorist following an accident, they would simply order a blood draw at the hospital without seeking a warrant, regardless of whether there was time to obtain one.

## The Facts of Commonwealth v. Hunte

The case involved a motor vehicle accident in which the driver, Hunte, was rendered unconscious. Police suspected DUI and, pursuant to Section 3755, ordered a blood draw without obtaining a warrant. There was no emergency preventing officers from seeking a warrant—they simply didn't bother because the statute said they didn't have to.

Hunte later moved to suppress the blood test results, arguing that the warrantless draw violated both the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The trial court denied the motion, and Hunte was convicted. The case made its way to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which granted review to address whether Section 3755 was constitutional.

## The Supreme Court's Holding

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court's answer was clear and unanimous: Section 3755 is facially unconstitutional under both the federal and Pennsylvania constitutions. The Court's reasoning dismantled the statutory scheme piece by piece.

### The Warrant Requirement Is Not Optional

The Court began with first principles: the Fourth Amendment requires law enforcement to obtain a warrant before conducting a search, subject only to specifically defined exceptions. A blood draw is unquestionably a search under the Fourth Amendment—it's an invasion of bodily integrity that implicates the most fundamental privacy interests.

The Commonwealth argued that the exigent circumstances exception applied because alcohol dissipates from the bloodstream over time. The Court rejected this categorical approach, citing the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in *Missouri v. McNeely*, which held that the natural dissipation of alcohol does not create a per se exigency that justifies warrantless blood draws in every DUI case.

### "Implied Consent" Is Not Real Consent

The Court then addressed the elephant in the room: Pennsylvania's implied consent statute. The Commonwealth argued that because drivers impliedly consent to testing by using Pennsylvania roads, no warrant is necessary.

The Court firmly rejected this argument. Real consent requires a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of constitutional rights. The legal fiction of "implied consent" based solely on the act of driving does not constitute actual consent to a warrantless search. As the Court explained, you cannot meaningfully "consent" to something before you even know you're suspected of a crime or that a search is contemplated.

Moreover, when a person is unconscious, they cannot provide even implicit consent. The very premise of Section 3755 was that officers could search unconscious individuals based on a legal fiction of prior consent—a theory the Court found constitutionally bankrupt.

### Unconsciousness Does Not Eliminate Constitutional Rights

Perhaps most importantly, the Court emphasized that unconscious individuals retain their constitutional rights. The Fourth Amendment doesn't evaporate simply because a person cannot actively assert their rights at a given moment. To hold otherwise would create a perverse incentive for law enforcement to prefer suspects who cannot object to searches.

The Court recognized that unconscious individuals are particularly vulnerable and deserve heightened protection, not diminished rights. Their inability to refuse or object makes judicial oversight through the warrant process even more critical, not less.

## The Practical Impact

This decision has immediate and far-reaching consequences for DUI enforcement in Pennsylvania:

### Warrants Are Now Required

Law enforcement must obtain a warrant before drawing blood from an unconscious DUI suspect. The only exception is if genuine exigent circumstances exist in the specific case that make obtaining a warrant impractical. Officers must evaluate each situation individually—they cannot rely on a blanket rule that alcohol dissipation alone justifies skipping the warrant requirement.

### Case-by-Case Exigency Analysis

In rare cases where truly exigent circumstances exist—for example, if obtaining a warrant would genuinely be impossible due to extraordinary circumstances—a warrantless draw might be justified. But these situations will be rare, and the burden will be on the Commonwealth to prove that such circumstances existed.

### Hundreds of Cases Affected

Any pending case where blood was drawn from an unconscious suspect without a warrant under Section 3755 is now vulnerable. Defense attorneys should immediately move to suppress such evidence. Even in cases where defendants were convicted, those with pending appeals may have grounds for reversal.

## Why This Decision Matters Beyond DUI Cases

*Commonwealth v. Hunte* is significant not just for DUI defendants but for constitutional law more broadly:

### Rejecting Convenience Over Rights

The decision sends a clear message that law enforcement convenience cannot override constitutional protections. Yes, obtaining warrants takes time and effort. Yes, in the age of electronic warrants, this burden is minimal. But even if it weren't, the Constitution requires it.

### Bodily Integrity Rights

The case reaffirms that our bodies are our own, and the government cannot invade them without meeting constitutional requirements. In an era of increasing biological surveillance and testing, this principle is more important than ever.

### Checking Legislative Overreach

Section 3755 represented an attempt by the legislature to create a categorical exception to the warrant requirement. The Court's decision reminds us that constitutional rights cannot be legislated away, even in service of important public safety goals like combating drunk driving.

## Comparing Hunte to Other Recent Decisions

*Commonwealth v. Hunte* fits into a broader trend in Pennsylvania Supreme Court decisions protecting constitutional rights in criminal cases. Just six months later, in *Commonwealth v. Shiflett* (discussed in our previous blog post), the Court again ruled in favor of defendants, holding that ARD acceptances cannot be used to enhance DUI sentences.

These decisions suggest a Court that takes seriously its role in protecting individual rights, even in cases involving serious public safety concerns. The Court has consistently held that the importance of combating crime, including DUI, does not justify shortcuts around constitutional protections.

## What This Means for DUI Defendants

If you're facing DUI charges in Pennsylvania, *Commonwealth v. Hunte* may be directly relevant to your case:

**If blood was drawn while you were unconscious:** If police drew your blood without a warrant while you were unconscious, that evidence should be suppressed unless the Commonwealth can prove genuine exigent circumstances existed. This is a fact-intensive inquiry that requires careful analysis of your specific case.

**If you're currently on appeal:** If you were convicted based on a warrantless blood draw from an unconscious suspect and your appeal is pending, *Hunte* provides strong grounds for reversal.

**If you have a trial pending:** Your attorney should immediately file a motion to suppress any blood evidence obtained without a warrant under Section 3755.

## The Dissenting Voices That Weren't There

What's particularly remarkable about *Hunte* is that it was unanimous. Every Justice agreed that Section 3755 was unconstitutional. This unanimity is significant—it shows that constitutional principles transcended any ideological divisions on the Court.

The decision demonstrates that when constitutional rights are clearly violated, even justices who might generally be sympathetic to law enforcement concerns will stand up for the Constitution. This should give defendants confidence that Pennsylvania courts will protect their rights even in cases involving serious charges.

## Looking Forward

*Commonwealth v. Hunte* doesn't make DUI enforcement impossible—it simply requires law enforcement to follow the Constitution. In the age of electronic warrants available 24/7, obtaining a warrant before drawing blood is neither difficult nor time-consuming. Most Pennsylvania counties now have systems where officers can obtain warrants in minutes via phone or computer.

What the decision does do is ensure that a neutral magistrate reviews the facts before the government invades a person's body. This is exactly what the Fourth Amendment requires, and it's a protection we should all value regardless of our views on DUI enforcement.

## Conclusion

*Commonwealth v. Hunte* represents a significant victory for constitutional rights in Pennsylvania. The decision confirms that even unconscious individuals retain their Fourth Amendment protections, that "implied consent" cannot substitute for real consent, and that law enforcement must obtain warrants before conducting blood draws except in truly exigent circumstances.

For those of us who practice DUI defense in Montgomery and Chester Counties, this decision provides a powerful tool to protect our clients' rights. But more fundamentally, it reaffirms that constitutional protections are not mere technicalities to be brushed aside in the pursuit of convictions—they are fundamental rights that courts will vigorously enforce.

If you're facing DUI charges involving blood evidence, particularly if that blood was drawn while you were unconscious, it's essential to work with an attorney who understands how decisions like *Hunte* affect your case. Constitutional challenges to evidence can make the difference between a conviction and a dismissal.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has made clear that the Constitution matters, even in DUI cases. As criminal defense attorneys, we'll continue to hold law enforcement and prosecutors to that standard.
